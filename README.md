# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
# My React App

This project is a **React** web application that allows users to interact with features (insert your project’s key functionality here). The project is built using **Vite** and **React.js** with **JavaScript** (not JSX extension).

Design Notes
Technology Stack:
React.js: For building the user interface and managing the state.
Vite: A build tool and development server used for fast development.
JavaScript: The project uses .js files for all components, avoiding JSX files.
Directory Structure:
The project follows a simple directory structure:

perl
Copy code
my-react-app/
├── src/
│   ├── components/      # Reusable components
│   ├── assets/          # Images, styles, and other assets
│   ├── App.js           # Main application component
│   └── main.js          # Entry point and rendering component
├── public/              # Public assets (e.g., index.html)
├── package.json         # Project metadata and dependencies
└── vite.config.js       # Vite configuration file
Design Decisions:
Vite for Fast Development: We chose Vite for its fast build times and excellent developer experience.
Component-Based Architecture: The app follows React’s component-based design, making it scalable and easy to maintain.
State Management: React's built-in useState and useEffect hooks are used for managing application state.
